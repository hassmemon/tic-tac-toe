# tic-tac-toe

## Tech Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Javascript

## Pseudocode

1. Setting up the board:

-   Create a 9x9 grid in HTML and CSS
-   Create a button and label it "Reset"

2. Creating gameplay functionality in Javascript:

-   Place O or X in a box upon clicking
-   Prevent the same box from being played twice
-   Switch players after every turn
-   Set all 16 victory conditions - 3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals for each of the 2 players
-   Set 1 draw condition
    The minimum turns needed to win a game are 5. The maximum number of turns to win a game is 8. If the game has still not been won by turn 8 then it is automatically a draw.
-   Ask the user to play again after win/draw
-   Clicking on the Reset button should reset the game

## Unsolved Problems

-   The game prompts the user if they would like to play again after win/draw. It should continue to prompt the user if the input is invalid.
